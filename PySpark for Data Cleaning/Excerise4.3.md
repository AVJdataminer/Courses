## Exercise:




We have a happiness database which was extracted from the Wallethub.com analysis on the happiest states in US ['https://wallethub.com/edu/happiest-states/6959/'].

### Methodology
In order to determine the happiest states in America, WalletHub compared the 50 states across three key dimensions: 1) Emotional & Physical Well-Being, 2) Work Environment and 3) Community & Environment.

We evaluated those dimensions using 31 relevant metrics, which are listed below with their corresponding weights. Each metric was graded on a 100-point scale, with a score of 100 representing maximum happiness.

Finally, we determined each stateâ€™s weighted average across all metrics to calculate its overall score and used the resulting scores to rank-order our sample.
